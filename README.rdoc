This is a Jobs Board application modeled on Glassdoor's job posting service. It has the ability to Add, Edit, Destroy jobs postings.
Each job post is assigned to a category, and we are able to filter between the various categories to see only jobs within that 
category (For example, only “Full-Time” jobs).  Custom styling was used (no bootstrap).  This application was built as a Ruby on Rails Tutorial.
